1. Open ./etc/jnode.conf and change your configuration as described.

2. Configure your mail settings for mail sending function & points autoregistration

3. Run ./bin/run.sh if you are running on Linux/FreeBSD/OS.

4. At the first run, jNode will add some entries to database. Look for messages and don't miss your technical point info (at log-file)!
 For example: 
    16-11-2023 17:45:29 [00000001] InstallUtil          [+] owner point account created
    16-11-2023 17:45:29 [00000001] InstallUtil
	FTN: 2:9999/9999.1
	Aka: Rodriguez Bender
	Password: 7e3fb3d2

5. Use data you got in previous step to config your point system. It's easy!
Keep in mind that jNode is a server-side software and it don't provides any UI for message handling.

6. You will find a netmail to your technical point with account to use web control panel. Also you will see it in console output.
Usualy admin panel is located at http://127.0.0.1:8080/secure/index.html

7. Log in and configure your node.

8. Enjoy and keep you software updated.
